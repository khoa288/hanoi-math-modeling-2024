# Hospital Shift Scheduling Optimization

## Files

-   **instructions.pdf**: Contains the problem description and requirements.
-   **report.pdf**: The final report detailing the problem-solving approach, model formulation, results, and evaluation.
-   **problem-modeling.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook that implements the shift scheduling optimization model.
-   **data.csv**: The dataset provided with the problem.
-   **non-iid-data.csv**: A dataset generated by us to further evaluate the generalization of the model in a non-iid case scenario.

## Usage

1. Open the `problem-modeling.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Run the cells in order to:
    - Set up the environment
    - Preprocess the data
    - Define the optimization model
    - Solve the model
    - Evaluate the results

## Customization

You can modify the following parameters in the notebook:

-   `model`: Choose between 'strict' and 'regulated' models
-   `data_file`: Select the input data file (`data.csv` or `non-iid-data.csv`)
-   Adjust constraints and objectives as needed

## Results

The notebook will output:

1. The optimal schedule
2. Evaluation metrics for the generated schedule
